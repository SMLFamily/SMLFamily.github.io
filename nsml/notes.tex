\item{21 June 88} ``The definition of Standard ML, Version 2''.
I have done and checked Robin's corrections to [25 Nov 87] 
as listed on my ``cover letter'' [ad 25 Nov 87].
Also, I have done and checked the red corrections 
of [13 August 87, annotated]. In addition the following changes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Exceptions have monotypes only. Rule (30) and restriction 1
in Section 4.9 have been modified accordingly. 

\item
The type constructor {\tt excn} has been changed to {\tt exn}.
(I have maintained {\it exn} to range over exeption names.)

\item
The type {\tt exn} does not admit equality. This has been
made explicit on the first page of appendix C.

\item
The third example of a real constant in Section 2.2 has been 
corrected (RM had earlier corrected master copy by hand).

\item
Abstype should hide equality outside the with part. Changes to
Section~4.7 and the present rule (19), formerly (21).

\item
The rule for constants in atomic patterns in the dynamic semantics
of the core (rule 36 in Version 1) changed so as to make the
types of constants more obvious.

\item
I have inserted sentences in Section 4.4 (Version 1) to the effect
that the equality attribute of a bound type variable in a type
function does not matter. Also, I have inserted sentences in Section 4.5
(Version 1) to the effect that the equality attributes of bound type
variables in type schemes do matter.

\item
My scheme for polymorphic references and exceptions tentatively
included. See ``Polymorphic References and Exceptions in the
ML Semantics'', 20 May 88, Mads Tofte, for a detailed list of
changes. In particular, I have undone the above change (that
exceptions have monotypes only) to allow exceptions
to have imperative types. (30 May 88)

\item
Basic exception constructors changed to start with a capital
letter (Bind, Match etc) in accordance with ``Unifying 
Exceptions with Constructors in Standard ML (30 May)''.
(30 May 88, mt)

\item
Semantics of programs, henceforth Section 8, included.
Corrections to the semantics of modules as detailed in
``Changes to ML Semantics to deal with Programs properly'',
RM 17/5/88 with my added handwritten notes.(31 May 88, mt)

\item
Previously ``applied'' functor forms have been turned into
derived forms and moved to Appendix A. 
The previously ``pure'' forms new appear directly in the grammar. (1 June 88,mt)

\item
Comments added in the section ``Closure Restrictions'' to clarify
the closure restrictions.  Comments also added on the rules for
signature declaration, functor specification and functor declaration
in the static semantics for modules for the same purpose.
(2 June 88, mt)

\item
The sentence stating that there are no derived forms form modules (first page
in the introduction) has been replaced by a reference to Appendix A. 
(6 June 88)

\item
In Figure 2, Pats has been changed to Pat. (6 June  88)

\item
A section ``Signature Matching'' has been inserted in the static
semantics for modules, after Section 5.10 (Enrichment). This defines
matching as a combination of instantiation and enrichment.
Also, the definition of functor matching in Section 5.13 has been
simplified using the notion of matching. (8 June 88, mt)

\item
Section 6.2 (Simple Objects), below figure. The following has been deleted:
`` or of a failing attempt to handle an exception with a handle rule''.
(9 June 88)

\item
Section 6.3, last paragraph. ``completely separately'' replaced by ``separately'', because of the new Section 8. (9 June 88)

\item
Page 55, Version 1. Wrong heading ``Labelled Patterns'' replaced by
``Pattern Rows''. (9 June 88)

\item
Page 40, Version 1. Heading ``Structure-level Bindings'' replace by
``Structure Bindings'' in accordance with page 15 and page 60.
(9 June 88)

\item
Page, 64, Figure 18. The derived form for raise expression has been 
deleted. (9 June 88)

\item
Page 65, Figure 19. Wrong heading ``LABELLED PATTERNS'' has been replaced by
``PATTERN ROWS''. Moreove, in the same figure, ``TYPES'' has been
replaced by ``TYPE EXPRESSIONS''.(9 June 88)

\item
In the display in Section 6.4 (Basic Values), the \verb+\+ has
been replace by \verb+/+ (division of reals). (13 June 88)

\item
Section 2.5, the first sentence. A reference to Section 2.7 has been
added, since \verb+#+{\it lab} introduces a new lexical item. This has
been added to Section 2.7. (13 June 88)

\item
Section 3. Since there are at present derived forms for functors,
the introduction to Section 3 has been changed. (13 June 88)

\item
Rule 91 (Version 1) has been corrected. (The result part of
a functor signature resulting from the elaboration of a 
functor signature expression must be principal).(14 June 88)

\item
The heading ``Functor Signatures'' in Figure 20 (current version)
concerning derived forms has been replace by ``Functor Signature
Expressions''. Also, the compound ``functor signatures'' has
been replaced by ``functor signature expressions'' on the first
page of Appendix A (Derived Forms). (15 June 88)

\item
We use the term ``constructor binding'' instead of  ``datatype construction''.
The syntactic classes are renamed accordingly. 

\item
The title of the document has been changed to ``The definition
of Standard ML''. (15 June 88)

\item
Appendix C, bottom of first page: \verb+io_failure+ has been changed to
\verb+Io+. (15 June 88)

\item
Section 3.1 (Reseved Words, Syntax of Modules). The {\tt open}
has been removed since it is already in the core langugae.
(15 June 88)

\item
Section 8. Changed ``store'' to ``state'' throughout. (16 June 88).

\item
Syntax of the Core, Figure 2. Replaced ``type expression rows''
by ``type-expression rows''. (17 June 88).

\item
Page 75 (current version). Templates added at the top of Figure 26 and 27.
(17 June 88).

\item
Section 7.1 (Reduced Syntax, Dynamic semantics of modules), first
item. The ``are omitted from exception bindings'' has been replaced
by ``are omitted from exception descriptions''. (20 June 88)
\end{enumerate}

\item{24 June 88.}``The definition of Standard ML, Version 2''.
Most of the following changes are prompted by Robin's reading
of [21 June]. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The preface to Version 2 has been revised following RM's notes (not
followed to the letter, however). (23 June 88)

The term ``functor matching'' has been replaced by ``functor signature
matching'' throughout. (23 June 88)

\item
The term ``store attribute'' has been replaced by ``imperative attribute''.
(23 June 88)

\item

have been inserted. A comment to the rule has been inserted. This change
is also mentioned in the preface to Version 2.
(23 June 88)

\begin{center}
\large Version 4 (for publication)
\end{center}
\begin{description}
\item{25 July 89} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Page 3. Several small changes to clarify what printable characters
are and what \verb+\^+$c$ means.
\item Page5, last par. of  Sect. 2.4. The word ``parser'' has been
replace by ``compiler'' as the classification of variables,
value constructors and exception constructors cannot be done
in normal context free parsing (the scope of constructors is more 
conveniently dealt with during type checking).
\item Page 9, Fig. 4.  For uniformity, <op> has been allowed in front
of longcon and longexcon in atpat.
\item Page 21--22. Section 4.9 has been substantially revised
in reaction to Simon Finn's comments on the well-formedness
of type structures.  There are new concepts of type structures
being well-formed and of type structures and type environments
respecting equality.  Rules 19 and 20 have been given as side
condition that TE respect equality. The comments to these
rules have been revised accordingly.
\item Page 33, Sect. 5.3. The two first lines, which referred to
the well-formedness of type environenments, have been deleted.
item Page 35, Sect.5.13.  The definition of principal signatures
has been modified to allude to structures respecting equality.
\item Page 72. Inserted <op> in front of constants and exception 
constants in atomic patterns.
\item Index: inserted entries for \verb;^;, control charater and printable
character. Also entries for respecting equality. Entry for well-formed
type environments deleted.
\end{enumerate}
\item{27 July} More changes
\begin{enumerate}
\item Page 2. Last paragraph of the Introduction has been rewritten.
\item Pages 3--4. Slanted font for defined terms in Section 2 (integer 
constant, real constant,  string constant, comment and identifiers).
\item Page 21. The title of Sect. 4.9 has been shortened to
``Type Structures and Type Environments''.
\item Page 33. Sect. 5.5 has been modified to require the {\sl
combined} admissibility of the basis and the result of the elaboration.
\item Page 35. Section on Principal Signatures has been extended to
cover the notion of a basis {\sl covering} a structure.  This is 
needed in order to get signatures. In Version 3 there are {\sl not}
principal signatures, due to examples like
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
structure A =
  struct
    structure B1 = struct end
    structure B2 = struct end
  end 
structure A: sig structure B1: sig end end = A;
signature Sig = 
 sig
  structure A1 : sig structure B1: sig end
                     structure B2: sig end
                 end
  sharing A1 = A
 end;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
\item{3 August, more changes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Page 2. `in the basis' repl. by `against the background provided'
\item Page 2, last paragraph about `claims' adjusted
\item Page 23, side conditions in slant.
\item Page 17, Remark about $\cup$ before figure
\item Page 21, $con(v)$ repl. by $(con,v)$. Definition of `respecting equality' added.
