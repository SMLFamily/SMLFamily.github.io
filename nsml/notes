Two points arising from chat with Dave:
 1) I agree with him that it's a little better to have # as a keyword,
    #lab as a new expression form.  (This will allow space in "# lab"
    which is OK I think).  So I think the simplest is
     a) include # as a keyword in 2.1
     b) delete the (new) second paragraph of 2.7
     c) Replace "#lab" by "# lab" in Fig 17 and in Fig 21
    I think that's all the change needed.  Dave's point is valid I think
    - that it's annoying to have a new lexical item in a derived form, and
    gives the (false) impression that things are more complex than they are.
 2) (next mail)
