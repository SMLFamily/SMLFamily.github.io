TODO
- extend definition of non-expansive to package expressions & functors (what about recursive module expressions ?)
- simplify longstrid and longfunid rules ala longvid
- consider removing vidpath and "longmodid where ..." expressions
  since they are (more or less) definable (unlike tyconpath).
  removing them reduces # of rules, simplifies definition of
  non-expansive, and the compiler!
- improve explanation of functor signature expressions.
- consider relaxing restriction on applicative decs to applicative functor
  bodies, to allow more instance of package elimination.
- there is a descrepancy between the implementation of Str in mosml, which
  can contain a GE, and the definition, which cannot. In mosml,
  we use extended Str's so they can double as environments...
