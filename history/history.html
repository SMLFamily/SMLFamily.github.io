  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-4-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML
  (TENTATIVE)</a>, by Robin Milner, April, 1983. The first draft of Milner's
  proposal for core Standard ML, which provided the basis for discussions
  at the first informal Standard ML meeting at Edinburgh in early April, 1983.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-changes-4-83.pdf">Changes to proposal for standard
  ML</a>, by Robin Milner, April/May 1983(?).
  Changes to the initial TENTATIVE proposal, probably in response to
  discussions at the first Standard ML meeting and comments on the
  circulated Proposal.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-6-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML
  (second draft)</a>, by Robin Milner, June 1983. The second draft of Milner's
  proposal for core Standard ML, incorporating changes resulting from discussions
  and correspondence after the first informal Standard ML meeting in
  April, 1983. Section 1.1 gives some early history.

  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-11-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML</a>, by

  proposal for core Standard ML.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-7-84.pdf">The Standard ML Core Language</a>, by

  same as described in "A Proposal for Standard ML", appearing
  in the 1984 ACM Conference on LISP and Functional Programming,
  Austin, Texas.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-10-84.pdf">The Standard ML Core Language</a>, by
  Robin Milner, October, 1984. The second draft of the "Core Langauge"
  design.
