<h1>The History of Standard ML</h1>
<p>
This page will contain links to historical documents related to the
development and evolution of the ML language, and Standard ML in
particular.
</p>
<h2>Papers and Talks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="macqueen-lucafest.pdf">Luca Cardelli and the Early Evolution
  of ML</a>, by David MacQueen. A paper presented at the Luca
  Cardelli Fest at Microsoft Research Cambridge on Sept. 8, 2014.

<a href="ML2015-talk.pdf">The History of Standard ML: Ideas,
  Principles, Culture</a>, by David MacQueen. A paper presented at the
  ML Family Workshop, Vancouver, September 3, 2015
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Documents</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-4-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML
  (TENTATIVE)</a>, by Robin Milner, April, 1983. The first draft of Milner's
  proposal for core Standard ML, which provided the basis for discussions
  at the first informal Standard ML meeting at Edinburgh in early April, 1983.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-changes-4-83.pdf">Changes to proposal for standard
  ML</a>, by Robin Milner, April/May 1983(?).
  Changes to the initial TENTATIVE proposal, probably in response to
  discussions at the first Standard ML meeting and comments on the
  circulated Proposal.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-6-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML
  (second draft)</a>, by Robin Milner, June 1983. The second draft of Milner's
  proposal for core Standard ML, incorporating changes resulting from discussions
  and correspondence after the first informal Standard ML meeting in
  April, 1983. Section 1.1 gives some early history.
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="SML-proposal-11-83.pdf">A Proposal for Standard ML</a>, by
  Robin Milner, November 1983. The third draft of Milner's
  proposal for core Standard ML.

  Robin Milner, July 1984.  The language described is essentially the
  same as described in "A Proposal for Standard ML", appearing

  Austin, Texas.
  </li>
  <li>
