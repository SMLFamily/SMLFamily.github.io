<H2><A NAME="section:0"></A>Introduction</H2>
<P>
These web pages contain the interface specifications for the modules of the <B>SML Basis Library</B>, which is a standard library for the 1997 Revision of SML<B>[CITE]</B>. The SML Basis Library provides interfaces and operations for basic types, such as integers and strings, support for input and output (I/O), interfaces to basic operating system interfaces, and support for standard datatypes, such as options and lists. The Library does <EM>not</EM> attempt to define higher-level APIs, such as collection types or graphical user-interface components. These APIs are left for other libraries.
<P>
This document may be distributed freely over the internet as long as the copyright notice and license terms below are prominently displayed within every machine-readable copy. The SML Basis Library is also published as a book by <EM><A HREF="http://www.cup.org">Cambridge University Press</A></EM>. In addition to the manual pages, the book also contains tutorial descriptions of programming techniques and idioms for effective use of the Library's interfaces.
<P>
The design philosophy of the SML Basis Library is to use the SML module system as an organizing tool. All type, exception, and value identifiers are bound in some module. A small number of these, which are called <EM>pervasive identifiers</EM>, are also bound at top-level (<I>i.e.</I>, without qualification). In addition, the top-level environment defines overloading of some identifiers.
<P>
The components (<I>i.e.</I>, signatures, structures, and functors) of the SML Basis Library are divided into <EM>required</EM> and <EM>optional</EM> components. Required components must be provided by all SML implementations, while optional components are just that. In some cases, support for one optional component entails providing support for others.
<P>
These webpages are organized as follows: the overview page describes the different kinds of interfaces provided by the SML Basis Library as well as which components are required and optional. The bulk of this document is a collection of <EM>manual pages</EM>, each of which describes an interface (<I>i.e.</I>, signature) and its implementations.
