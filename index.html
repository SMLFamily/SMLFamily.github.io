    <h1>Standard ML Family GitHub Project</h1>


This is the web page for the Standard ML Family GitHub
project (organization name: SMLFamily).  This site is very much "under
construction", and it replaces the earlier
SourceForge web site for standardml.org (which now redirects to this
page).  Contributions, corrections, and suggestions for additional
information are very much welcomed.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<P>
The Standard ML Family project provides a home for online versions
of various formal definitions of Standard ML, including the
"Definition of Standard ML, Revised" (Standard ML 97).
The site also supports coordination between different
implementations of the Standard ML (SML) programming language by
maintaining common resources such as the documentation for the
<a href="Basis/index.html">Standard ML Basis Library</a>
and standard test suites. The goal is to increase compatibility
and resource sharing between Standard ML implementations.
</P>
<P>
The site includes a <a href="#History">history section</a> devoted to
the history of ML, and of Standard ML in particular. This section will
contain a collection of original source documents relating to the
design of the language.
</P>

<h2>Definitions of Standard ML</h2>

<p>With the permission of MIT Press, we are able to make
<a href="sml90-defn.pdf">The Definition of Standard ML</a> (SML '90)
and
<a href="sml97-defn.pdf">The Definition of Standard ML, Revised</a>
(SML '97) available for downloading as pdf files.  These are
(currently) formatted for US letter page size.  Printed copies
of the SML '97 definition are available from
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/definition-standard-ml">MIT Press.</a>
</p>

<p>
The SML '90 definition is complete, including the index, but we are still
working on recreating the index for the SML '97 definition.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The source LaTeX files for the SML '90 and SML '97 definitions are
now maintained at GitHub under the organization SMLFamily. Contact
<a href="mailto:dmacqueen@mac.com>David MacQueen</a> if you wish to
join this organization and have access to the repositories.
</p>
